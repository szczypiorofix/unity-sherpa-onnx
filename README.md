# unity-sherpa-onnx
Sherpa ONNX wrapper for Unity

## Disclaimer
All code from Android (sherpa-android/SherpaOnnxPlugin/src/main/java/com/k2fa/sherap/onnx) was rewrited for Jova but originally comes from [Sherpa ONNX Repository](https://github.com/k2-fsa/sherpa-onnx).
I just rewrited the code for Java and better understanding (for me), so generally the credits go not for me.
