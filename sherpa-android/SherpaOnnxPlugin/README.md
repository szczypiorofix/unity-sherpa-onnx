# Sherpa ONNX Plugin

## Disclaimer
All code (/src/main/java/com/k2fa/sherap/onnx) was rewrited for Java  but originally (in Kotlin) comes from [Sherpa ONNX Repository](https://github.com/k2-fsa/sherpa-onnx).
I just rewrited the code for Java and better understanding (for me), so generally the credits go not for me.

## Additional libraries and models

- ./src/main/jniLibs/*.* - Sherpa .so libraries for different architecture
